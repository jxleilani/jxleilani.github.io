         I'm 31 years old, from Holyoke, MA, and a new mom of a 5 month old!
         <br> I have a bachelor's in economics with a minor in IT. I am also working towards a master's in IT.
         I currently work in higher education, within the data and information services team. 
         I have some experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and SQL and am excited to dive in and focus on my coding.
         <br><br>
         <strong>Fun Facts: </strong>I have also bartended for 10+ years. In my free time I enjoy 
         salsa dancing, horse back riding, body building, and being with my family.
